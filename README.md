## About IVFM  - `Invisible Farm`
Invisible Farm is a community-driven tool that cultivates and captures the intangible values inherent in human relationships. Through the utilization of NFTs, it visualizes and enhances these values, ultimately adding value to them.

At the core of our philosophy lies the ambition to capture the essence and worth exchanged between individuals. This fundamental principle propelled the inception of our project, as we recognized the invaluable contributions made by individuals within communities that transcend conventional metrics such as labor, knowledge, and skills. These contributors, encompassing mood makers and advisors, exert a positive influence on others through their embodiment of values like passion, trust, and humor. However, quantifying and appropriately rewarding their impact presents a significant challenge. While hard skills can be easily measured, soft skills remain qualitative in nature, making them harder to demonstrate.

Acknowledging the significance of evaluating soft skills, many companies on job matching platforms encounter difficulties in effectively assessing and managing these attributes during recruitment and performance evaluation processes.

While existing ecosystems like Polygon Identity offer verification services encompassing identity, age, community affiliations, personal preferences, and career history, there remains a conspicuous void in services that authenticate qualitative aspects. Consequently, our solution materializes in the form of a Value Capture Ecosystem that transcends mere recognition of created value, instead fostering behaviors that acknowledge and express appreciation for this value.

To this end, we have introduced a letter-writing approach wherein community members compose letters expressing gratitude for the discovered value contributed by others. To facilitate this process, we leverage the Polygon Identity solution, providing proof of membership within the same community. Additionally, we enable the letter sender to bestow a PROOF OF VALUE SBT, serving as tangible evidence of the recipient's value creation. Furthermore, recipients are presented with AI-generated NFTs called "Incense," meticulously designed to appreciate in value over time, thereby granting them the opportunity to receive rewards.

Finally, our platform encompasses My Value Mapping, featuring a comprehensive Vibe Map and Value Chart. This dynamic component enables individuals to showcase and share their soft skills and capabilities, grounded in the certificates and NFTs they have received.

Through our innovative and intricately designed system, we strive to revolutionize the paradigm of value recognition and appreciation within communities, fostering a culture that thrives on the essence of intangible yet indispensable contributions.
